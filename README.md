## 🚀 Statement

MementoDAO is a project for event curation, and memories preservation by using badges built on top of the FVM network. The goal is to create an end-to-end platform for event organizers to issue unique and valuable badges, similar to POAPs, and for attendants to earn, collect and showcase them. By leveraging Filecoin's storage capabilities, we aim to store and provide rich datasets related to events and badges metadata, making it an integral part of the DataDAO ecosystem.

## 💬 Pitch

## ⚠️ Problem

POAPs have become increasingly popular, but there are some concerns about their centralization:

-   Currently, a single private entity funded by venture capital is responsible for managing the project and its future, and there is no so much room for community to participate on its decisions.
-   All POAPs assets are stored on a private API that serves as a single point of failure. If this API goes down, all existing POAPs would become useless, as their metadata and assets would be lost.
-   The process to create new POAPs is somehow opaque and managed by a closed entity, making it difficult to scale and some aspects are unclear for users.
-   There are also concerns around farming and bots, and the solutions implemented by POAP Inc. to address these issues have not always been well-received by users.
-   These challenges prevent POAPs from becoming a widely and truly accessible public good for preserving digital memories.

## 💡 Solution

-   MementoDAO solution is a platform that enables event creators to create and manage events and their associated digital badges.
-   To ensure permanent storage and preservation of assets, the platform leverages Filecoin technology.
-   The platform is governed through a decentralized organization. A transparent curation body as part of the DAO is also in place to ensure that the platform becomes a truly public good.
-   Collectors will have access to these digital badges, farming is prevented by implementing Soulbound tokens with social recovery abilities.
-   By leveraging the properties of FVM data DAOs, we aim to incentivize the DAO mechanics and monetize a valuable, curated events dataset to make the system sustainable.

## 💻 How I made it

-   Integral web application to manage the Events creation, Badges issuance and displaying, DAO governance and Curation body
-   It was my first time using the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM) and the sponsors' technologies so some parts where difficult to understand and implement.
-   The tech stack includes:
    -   Frontend: Next.js, React, Tailwind, Wagmi, ConnecKit
    -   Smart contracts: Solidity, Hardhat, Open Zeppelin libraries
    -   Sponsors’ technology: Hudle01, Livepeer, Push Protocol, Lighthouse
    -   Deployed to Spheron Network
-   Despite the difficulties, I was mostly able to bring the vision to life and prototype this project in the form of an MVP.

## ✨ Potential use-cases

Potential use cases for the MementoDAO ecosystem are numerous:

-   A market for curated event data sets that can be monetized through premium exposure opportunities
-   Providing event organizers, brands, and creators with a way to bring in new audiences and foster loyalty
-   Token-gated content, leveraging the properties of the badges NFTs
-   A better platform for collectors to manage their badges and showcase them
-   Creating new job opportunities, such as joining the curation body or professionalizing event and badge creation
-   And much more, the possibilities are endless!

## 👷 Future roadmap

-   Integrating plugins for various social media platforms that can host online events such as Twitter, Discord, YouTube, Instagram, Twitch, etc.
-   Implementing a bridge to migrate existing POAPs to mementoDAO badges.
-   Premium positioning options for events in exchange for a fee to the DAO.
-   Mechanisms to incentivize deals from Filecoin nodes.
-   Improved tokenomics system to ensure a sustainable growth of the DAO.
-   Marketplace for the events dataset to monetize all the information generated by the DAO.
-   Customizable badge galleries for users to showcase in different artistic and personal ways.
